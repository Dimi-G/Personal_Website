# Personal_Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal website built using Streamlit. The site can be found deployed [here](https://dimigko.streamlit.app/). It serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and interests and will be constantly updated.

**Requirements**

The site can be visited [online](https://personalwebsitegit-xytb8bcwzms2umagvmqobk.streamlit.app/).
If you want to run it locally, use python and install the dependencies from requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt.
To run, use command: streamlit run Main.py and follow instructions for viewing it in your local browser (usually it is http://localhost:8501 )
